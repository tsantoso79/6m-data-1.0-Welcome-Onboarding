## WSL for Windows

### *For Windows users only* - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows users should install WSL which allows you to run Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. WSL allows you to install a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, etc.) and use Linux applications and utilities such as command-line (CLI) tools. 

Most software engineering and development tools are initially developed for Linux and then adapted for Windows. As a result, they often perform better on Linux. Although Windows versions of popular tools are widely available, we strongly recommend using the Linux version whenever possible for optimal performance.
You must be running Windows 11 or 10 version 2004 and higher. 

For a step by step installation instruction guide, please refer to [here](guides/install_wsl.md).

For a very basic usage guide, please refer to [here](guides/wsl_linux_basics.md)

If you encounter issues with the guide above, you can refer to the official installation instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install Ubuntu on WSL.

### Additional Learning Resource
You can access your WSL files using regular Windows applications, such as File Explorer. While you in your Linux directory, type: 

`explorer.exe .`

Read this [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) to find out how it works.

Please refer to [Reference - WSL on Windows](reference.md#wsl-on-windows) for more learning resource on WSL.

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

You will need a code editor to write Python or SQL code in the course. VSCode is a popular source code editor used by developers for writing, debugging and editing code across various programming languages. 

Download and install VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Git vs GitHub

Git and GitHub are two essential tools in software engineering. Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in their code locally. GitHub is a web-based platform where developers can store and share their Git projects, facilitating collaboration and code management. Together, they enable a workflow where developers work on code locally with Git and then share it on GitHub for others to see, review, and contribute. This combination supports efficient collaboration, version control, and project management, making it indispensable for modern software engineering teams.

## Git CLI

We will be using Git extensively in this course and you will need to install the command line interface (CLI) application on your computer.

### Download and install Git CLI [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

For WSL users, git is already installed in Ubuntu. However, you need to configure git. Please follow the config guide below.

[Video: Install Git for Mac User](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_NdWjc4pqYkuaFqRgYCGI62FoDufK4Bs/view?usp=drive_link)

### Configure Git (Apply to Mac and Windows User)
For Mac users, you need to launch a `terminal` to perform the following configuration. For Windows (WSL) user, please note that you need to launch `WSL` or `Ubuntu` to run the following configuration.

- Launch `WSL` (Windows user) or `terminal` (Mac Users)

Run the following command:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "your_github_email@domain.com"
```

To confirm the configuration above 
```bash
git config --global --list
```

#### Additional config (Mac Users Only - Optional)
Mac users may run the following command to avoid possible error in the future:
```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```

If you encounter error in syncing your git repository please use the command above.

### Connecting VScode with Github
To connect Github with VSCode, you just need to click `Clone Git Repository` at the `Welcome` page. To access the welcome page, on the menu bar click `Help` > `Welcome`

Please checkout the video belong which applies for both Mac and Windows user.

> The video above also applies to Windows and Mac user. Only exception is that Windows users are required to connect to WSL first.

### Additional Learning Resource
Windows WSL users may read this official tutorial [Get Started using Git on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) to understand more about Git in WSL. *You may ignore the Azure setup.*

Please refer to [Reference - Git and Github](reference.md#git-and-github) for more learning resource on Git and Github.

## Conda/Miniconda

Conda is a package and environment manager that we will be using throughout this program, to manage our Python packages and environments. Miniconda is a lightweight version of the Anaconda distribution, designed for users who prefer a minimal installation. It includes only the essentials: Python, conda (the package and environment manager), and their dependencies. Unlike Anaconda, which comes preloaded with hundreds of scientific packages, Miniconda allows you to install only the packages you need, making it more flexible and less resource-intensive.

### Special Notes for Intel Mac

Please note that Anaconda has stopped building packages for Intel Mac. Their official message is as follows:

> As of August 15, 2025, Anaconda has stopped building packages for Intel Mac computers (osx-64). Existing Intel (MacOSX-x86_64) installers are still available at https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/ and the last Miniconda installer release for Intel Mac computers will be 25.7.x. For more information, see [our blog](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/intel-mac-package-support-deprecation) on the end of Intel mac support.

For Intel Mac users, you can still download miniconda at https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh. However, please make plan to migrate to Mac with Apple chips.


### Download and install miniconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)

> Windows WSL users, please follow instructions for **Linux/Unix**. You must install miniconda in your WSL **Ubuntu** environment, not Windows.

Windows WSL users can also follow the step by step instruction [here](guides/wsl_install_miniconda.md).

Mac users please follow the following guide [here](guides/mac_install_miniconda.md)

To verify this, your conda command prompt should show `(base) $`
